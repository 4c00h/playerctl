players. In addition to offering play/pause/stop control, \fBplayerctl\fR\&
also offers previous/next track support, the ability to seek backward/forward\&
in a track, and volume control.
\fBplayerctl\fR also supports displaying metadata (e.g. artist/title/album) for the\&
current track, and showing the status of the player.

Players that can be controlled using \fBplayerctl\fR include audacious, cmus,\&
